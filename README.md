##Purpose

This project consists of migrating an internal web application, called HRnet, which manages employee files. The application is old and uses jQuery on the front end.

Goals :

* Convert the entire HRNet project to React.
* Convert one of the four current jQuery plugins to React. Replace the remaining 3 jQuery plugins with existing React components, code and publish the last one yourself.
* Perform Lighthouse benchmarks comparing the old and new app.
